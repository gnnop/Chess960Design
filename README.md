This is a brief note for anyone who comes across this repository. Compile the .tex project to see the pdf representing the 4-sided cards, each with a chess position. Eventually, I will make a script that generates the tex. In that case, you call the script to generate the .tex file, then,  use the tex to generate all the unique cards. Ideally, what you realize is that I start an awesome kickstarter that lets me manufacture these cards at a discount for you, but you are perfectly free to do it yourself.
